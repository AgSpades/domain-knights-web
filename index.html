            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>An independent community-based group for the members of Domain Knights to share experiences about anime and manga, and to share theories, Japanese culture, otaku culture, and Japanese horror stories. Domain Knights is an independent community with no specific connection or federation with any other community/group. Established on November 15, 2020, the community initially focused on Jujutsu Kaisen but has since opened to general anime-related content, including manga and manhwa. It is now a public community where everyone is welcome to join and discuss their interests, except for political and religious topics.</p>
